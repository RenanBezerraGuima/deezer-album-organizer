## 2025-05-14 - [Confirmation Dialog for Destructive Actions]
**Learning:** In a local-first application where data is stored in localStorage, accidental deletion is a high-risk event because there is no easy server-side restore. Adding a confirmation dialog for folder deletion is a critical UX safeguard that aligns with the "Palette" philosophy of making interaction feel smooth and safe.
**Action:** Always implement confirmation steps or "undo" patterns for destructive actions in local-first apps to maintain user trust and prevent data loss.
